The protocol has been modified and the PSI-BLAST profiles are now replaced with hhblits PSSMs. Performance is slighty improved:

Cross-validated per-residue performance:
MCC:        0.4412
Precision:  0.7125
Recall:     0.5292
TPR:        0.7523
FPR:        0.3121
TP:         3231
FP:         1304
TN:         2874
FN:         1064
Targets:    75/75

Compiling
---------

Tested under Ubuntu 13.04. First set the paths to the hhsuite bin directory, and an hhblits database, in the Perl script:

my $hhpath = "/home/tnugent/Applications/hhsuite-2.0.13-linux-x86_64/bin";
my $dbname = "/home/tnugent/databases/uniprot20_02Sep11";

Then to compile, just run make (then optionally, make test).

Run as follows, passing in a FASTA file:

./hhlipex.pl input/1gzmA.fa	

In the output file, scores > 0.5 indicate the residue (one per line) is predicted to be lipid exposed.
